Go ABI Demo
-------------------

This directory contains a single code file, `abi.go`.

In it is a demonstration of the use of the SDK methods used to interact with the Algorand ABI.

Make sure you've run the items mentioned in the root README

Install dependencies for this demo

The current work for this feature is in this PR: https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand-sdk/pull/258

For now I've checked it out in a local directory and replace it in the go.mod file. You'll have to do the same until this is merged.

```sh
go get
```


run `go run ./*.go`


Happy Hacking :)
